## Introduction
C++ is a **cross-platform** language that can be used to create high-performance applications. It was developed by **Bjarne Stroustrup**, as an extension to the **C** language. It gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory. It is an **object-oriented** programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
## Why use C++?
C++ is a **middle-level language** rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both **C** and **C++** are the same. 
You should use C++ because it is: 

    ●  Portable
    ●  Machine independant
    ●  User-friendly
    ●  Faster in Speed
    ●  Has Rich libraries support

## LinkedList
Like arrays, Linked List is a **linear data structure**. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a **contiguous location**; the elements are linked using pointers. 
### Why LinkedList??
    Arrays can be used to store linear data of similar types, but arrays have the following limitations:
     ●  The size of the arrays is fixed.
     ●  Inserting a new element in an array is expensive.

    It provides following advantages over arrays: 
     ●  Dynamic size 
     ●  Ease of insertion/deletion

### Types of LinkedList
There are **three** common types of Linked List.

- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List
